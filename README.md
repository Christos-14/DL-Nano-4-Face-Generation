## Project 4: Face Generation

In this project, I defined and trained a DCGAN on a dataset of faces aiming to get a generator network to generate new images of faces that look as realistic as possible!

The main artefacts are:

- Downloading and pre-processing data
- Creating DataLoaders
- Building the DCGAN model
- Training the DCGAN model
- Generating sample face images
